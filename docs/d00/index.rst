NYC Charter
=================================

As part of the '1898 consolidation of New York City <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_New_York>'_, the 'New York State Legislature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Legislature>'_ enacted a charter for the consolidated city. The Charter was overhauled in 1989, after the 'New York City Board of Estimate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Board_of_Estimate>'_ had been declared unconstitutional, to redistribute power from the Board of Estimate to the 'Mayor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City>'_ and 'City Council <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council>'_.
